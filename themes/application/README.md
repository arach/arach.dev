# Application Themes

Comprehensive theming system for building consistent, professional application UIs. These themes define complete visual languages for interactive applications.

## Purpose

Unlike simple website themes, application themes provide:
- Complete component styling (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
- Interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- Data visualization colors and patterns
- Consistent spacing and sizing systems
- Accessibility considerations

## Available Themes

- **Terminal** - Classic terminal/CLI aesthetic
- **Terminal Hybrid** - Terminal with CSS variable enhancements
- **Directory** - File explorer inspired theme

## Theme Capabilities

Application themes define styling for:
- **Forms**: Inputs, selects, checkboxes, radios
- **Buttons**: Primary, secondary, ghost, sizes, states
- **Feedback**: Alerts, toasts, notifications
- **Layout**: Cards, panels, sidebars
- **Data**: Tables, charts, graphs
- **Navigation**: Menus, tabs, breadcrumbs

## Usage

These themes are primarily used by the styleguide (`/styleguide`) to demonstrate the design system capabilities. They serve as a reference implementation for building cohesive application interfaces.

## Adding Application Themes

New themes should provide comprehensive coverage of all UI patterns. See existing themes for the expected structure and scope.
