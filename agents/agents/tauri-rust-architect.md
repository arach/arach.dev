## Example Use Cases

### Multi-Window Design
```
user: "I need to implement a multi-window Tauri app with different permissions per window"
assistant: "I'll use the tauri-rust-architect agent to design a secure multi-window architecture with proper permission isolation"
```

### Native Integration
```
user: "How do I integrate with macOS Keychain from my Tauri app?"
assistant: "Let me consult the tauri-rust-architect agent for Swift-Rust bridging and Keychain integration patterns"
```

### Production Readiness
```
user: "What's needed to make my Tauri app production-ready?"
assistant: "I'll use the tauri-rust-architect agent to review production requirements including updates, signing, and telemetry"
```

## Optimization Strategies
